The job postings include salary ranges, location, work mode (e.g., remote or on-site), and technical requirements — making them highly valuable for analyzing the job market. This dataset enables the assessment of differences in compensation, demand for specific technologies, and the popularity of remote work. It also allows for tracking occupational trends over time, which makes it a useful resource for job seekers.\n",
